# Natural-Language-Processing

## Gutenberg project
Using Python’s NLTK library, i loaded 10 books of our choice from project
Gutenberg corpus (supported by NLTK).Then we created a dictionary from all
of them words that appear in each book and divided the texts into sentences and
tokens. After that we calculate frequencies of unigrams, bigrams and trigrams.
Finally we generated 10 sentences for each book using the bigrams and trigrams

## Movies Classifier
In this section i loaded from the Python NLTK librarythe movie reviews
dataset, which includes 2,000 movie reviews, of which 1,000 are positive (pos)
and the remaining 1,000 are negative (neg).Fistly we preprocessed our data and
then we trained a Na¨ıve Bayes classifier to classify correct positive and negative
reviews using as input ngrams and 2grams
